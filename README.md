# Class-Coordinator
This code is a one-stop spot for organizing your class schedules. Class Coordinator automatically extracts and organizes assignments and their due dates from your syllabus, allowing you to organize your semester with a few clicks. What is the result? A Google calendar is updated with all assignment due dates and descriptions of the assignment. Also, you get a Google Sheet with a list of all your assignments with due dates and descriptions. This Python script can help students start the semester off strong and organized.
